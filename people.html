      <p>I have been afraid make a page such as this, because I know I will forget someone just because of being forgetful and also there are lots of people.  I have decided that this webpage contains people who I do not share a webring with.  If you want more, please check out the webrings on the main page.</p>

<p>I share a webring with Viatrix, but she has a <a href="https://mincerafter42.github.io/fillbert/">webcomic</a>, as does the &amp; system (<a href="https://ampersandia.net/stranger_eons/">Stranger Eons</a>).</p>
<p>Tangentially, on the subject of webcomics, my favorite webcomic is <a href="https://egscomics.com/">El Goonish Shive</a>, and I promise that most of the webcomic is not like the beginning of the webcomic.</p>
