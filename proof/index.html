<p>so there's been this math problem stuck in my head for years and i finally came up with a solution</p>
<p>Suppose that you have a rectangle with integer side lengths which you want to fill with 1 by integer rectangles along the gridboi.  Which integer by integer rectangles can be filled by 1 by integer rectangles, without the 1 by integer rectangles forming any other rectangle?</p>
<p>It is only the 2x2 rectangle which cannot be filled.</p>
<h2>proof</h2>
<p>let us call the minimum side length b, and the maximum side length a.</p>
<h3>case: b geq 3</h3>
<p>there is a cool pattern for this which i must demonstrate with images.</p>
<h3>case: b = 2, a > 2</h3>
<p>there is a simple pattern for this.  you can put 1x1 rectangles on opposite corners, and then fill the rest in with two rectangles.</p>
<h3>case: b = 1</h3>
<p>trivial</p>
<h3>case: b = 2, a = 2</h3>
<p>no</p>
<h3>end of cases</h3>
<p>in each case but 2x2, it was possible.  2x2 is the only rectangle in which it is impossible</p>
