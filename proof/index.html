<p>so there's been this math problem stuck in my head for years and i finally came up with a solution</p>
<p>Suppose that you have a rectangle with integer side lengths which you want to fill with 1 by integer rectangles along the gridboi.  Which integer by integer rectangles can be filled by 1 by integer rectangles, without the 1 by integer rectangles forming any other rectangle?</p>
<p>every rectangle can be filled.</p>
<h2>proof</h2>
<p>let us call the minimum side length b, and the maximum side length a.</p>
<h3>case: b geq 3</h3>
<p>there is a cool pattern for this which i must demonstrate with images.</p>
<p>but basically,</p>
<ul>
<li>you put a 1x(a-1) rectangle and a 1x2 rectangle on the longest side.</li>
<li>you put a 1x(b-1) rectangle on the short side it fits on</li>
<li>you put a 1x(a-1) rectangle on the side it fits on.</li>
<li>you alternate between putting 1x(b-n) rectangles and 1x(a-n) rectangles next to the last-placed 1x(b-n) rectangles and 1x(a-n) rectangles</li>
</ul>
<h3>case: b = 2, a > 2</h3>
<p>there is a simple pattern for this.  you can put 1x1 rectangles on opposite corners, and then fill the rest in with two rectangles.</p>
<h3>case: b = 2, a = 2</h3>
<p>1x2 + 1x2</p>
<h3>case: b = 1</h3>
<p>trivial</p>
<h3>end of cases</h3>
<p>in every case, it is possible.  therefore, it is always possible</p>
