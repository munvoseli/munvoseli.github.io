      <p>Hello.  I am munvoseli.  I like conlangs, math, and programming.</p>
      <p>I have a list of projects here.  Some of these projects were made very long ago, but it could be that some of these are still active.</p>
      <p>Projects thrown in the munvoseli.github.io repo:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><a href="sometimesredsometimesblue.html">red blue</a> (not fun)</li>
	<li><a href="repeatyoutube.html">repeat youtube</a> (useful sometimes)</li>
	<li><a href="wykoff.html">a virtual touchscreen keyboard</a> (only fun sometimes and usable on some devices)</li>
	<li><a href="egspuzzle/egspuzzle.html">an el goonish shive-styled game based on a game i made in like 2016 or 2017 that i still have not named</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other browser-based projects from my GitHub:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><a href="/egscurl/randomegs.html">Random EGS comic</a></li>
	<li><a href="/voronoi-flag/">Voronoi-based LGBT flag wallpaper creator</a> (this is the thing on this page I use the most)</li>
	<li><a href="/celeste-text-formatter/celestetextexport.html">Thing that turns Celeste language files into their binary-ish counterparts</a></li>
	<li><a href="/celeste-image-extractor/celesteimage.html">Thing that renders Celeste .data images onto an HTML canvas</a></li>
	<li style="display: none;">A <a href="https://munvoseli.github.io/breadquest-client/socket.html">BreadQuest client</a>.  If you are signed in to BreadQuest, the WebSocket from the custom client uses the same auth stuff (hopefully).  However, you may need to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11768221/firefox-websocket-security-issue">disable a security feature</a> in order to get it to work if you're using it from local files.  Although I'm including it here, I made it mostly for me, and I haven't written any documentation on how to use it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Projects that are not browser-based:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>A <a href="https://github.com/munvoseli/mauve-audio">language made for the production of chiptune music</a>, written in C++.</li>
	<li>A <a href="https://github.com/munvoseli/keyboard-of-hospitality">keyboard-ish thing that uses keys</a>, made using C and SDL2.</li>
	<li>A <a href="https://github.com/munvoseli/quilt-font/">program</a> written in C that generates a FontForge file that looks kind of like a quilting pattern or something.  <a href="/quilt-font/index.html">Here is what the font looks like.</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Goodbye.</p>
