    <p>Hello.  I am munvoseli.  More specifically, "munvoseli" is a name that refers to the collection of mental facets in the head that is doing this typing.</p>
    <p>Some of these projects were made very long ago, but it could be that some of these are still active.</p>
    <p>Projects in the munvoseli.github.io repo:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="sometimesredsometimesblue.html">red blue</a></li>
      <li><a href="repeatyoutube.html">repeat youtube</a></li>
      <li><a href="wykoff.html">a virtual touchscreen keyboard</a></li>
      <li><a href="egspuzzle/egspuzzle.html">an el goonish shive-styled game based on a game i made in like 2016 or 2017 that i still have not named</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other projects from my GitHub:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/voronoi-flag/voronoi.html">Flag background creator thing</a></li>
      <li><a href="/celeste-text-formatter/celestetextexport.html">Thing that turns Celeste language files into their binary-ish counterparts</a></li>
      <li><a href="/celeste-image-extractor/celesteimage.html">Thing that renders Celeste .data images onto an HTML canvas</a></li>
      <li><a href="/egscurl/randomegs.html">Random EGS comic</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also made a <a href="https://munvoseli.github.io/breadquest-client/socket.html">BreadQuest client</a>.  If you were signed in to BreadQuest, the WebSocket from the custom client would use the same auth stuff.  However, that functionality has been broken (or bug has been fixed) in the latest version of Firefox.  At the time of writing, firefox-esr on Debian is still old enough that it works.  Last time I checked, it worked on Ubuntu as well.</p>
