    <p>Hello.  I am munvoseli.  More specifically, "munvoseli" is a name that refers to the collection of mental facets in the head that is doing this typing.</p>
    <p>Some of these projects were made very long ago, but it could be that some of these are still active.</p>
    <p>Projects in the munvoseli.github.io repo:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="sometimesredsometimesblue.html">red blue</a></li>
      <li><a href="repeatyoutube.html">repeat youtube</a></li>
      <li><a href="wykoff.html">a virtual touchscreen keyboard</a></li>
      <li><a href="egspuzzle/egspuzzle.html">an el goonish shive-styled game based on a game i made in like 2016 or 2017 that i still have not named</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other projects from my GitHub:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/voronoi-flag/voronoi.html">Flag background creator thing</a></li>
      <li><a href="/celeste-text-formatter/celestetextexport.html">Thing that turns Celeste language files into their binary-ish counterparts</a></li>
      <li><a href="/celeste-image-extractor/celesteimage.html">Thing that renders Celeste .data images onto an HTML canvas</a></li>
      <li><a href="/egscurl/randomegs.html">Random EGS comic</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also made a <a href="https://munvoseli.github.io/breadquest-client/socket.html">BreadQuest client</a>.  If you were signed in to BreadQuest, the WebSocket from the custom client would use the same auth stuff.  However, you may need to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11768221/firefox-websocket-security-issue">disable a security feature</a> in order to get it to work.  I'm working on a fix.</p>
