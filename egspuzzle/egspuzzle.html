	<h1>Fight the goo</h1>
	<p>Rules:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The goal of the game is to get rid of all the goo.</li>
	  <li>Get rid of goo by clicking on it.</li>
	  <li>You can only get rid of goo if the amount of eyes in a cell is less than or equal to the amount of neighboring cells that also have goo. (for a maximum of 8)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Also, the last tile on the board has to be a 0-eye tile if you're going to win.</p>
	<p>Sorry if you're colorblind. I tried to make a brightness difference, but I'm not sure if it's noticeable.</p>
