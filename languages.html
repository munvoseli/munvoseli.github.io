    <main>
      <p>I am proficient in JavaScript.  I am familiar with NodeJS, but NodeJS is not something I typically do.</p>
      <p>I know HTML, and am very passable at CSS when performing a task.  However, making things look good is hard due to not knowing what makes things look good.</p>
      <p>I am somewhat practiced in Java, and a little more practiced in C.</p>
      <p>I have a familiarity with SQL.</p>
      <p>I have worked in other languages, such as x86 Assembly and Lisp, but I do not consider myself to be qualified to do them for many (or any) purposes.</p>
